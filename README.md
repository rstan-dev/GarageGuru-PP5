## PROJECT DESIGN

  ### Agile Approach
  From the start the project was managed using [GitHub Projects (View Here - ensure labels are activated)](https://github.com/users/rstan-dev/projects/8/views/2), using an agile approach.
  - The project goals were broken into epics, which were broken into user stories with acceptance criteria and individual tasks.
  - Each user story was allocated a certain number of story points based on a rough estimation of time to complete the work.
  - This allowed me to create a roadmap with milestones and target dates. [View Roadmap Here(ensure milestone and start date markers are activated)](https://github.com/users/rstan-dev/projects/8/views/1)
  - Each User Story was assigned a label according to the MoSCoW system so I could prioritise the work.

  ### Wireframes
   The initial wireframes were created in [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.cloud/) to understand how the site would work, and this layout would drive User Stories, the logic required and overall design artwork decisions.
